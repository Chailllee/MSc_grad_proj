# Evaluating the Impact of Ultra Low Emission Zone Policies on Air Quality and Public Transportation Choices in Central London

## Overview

This repository contains the research and analysis conducted for the MSc dissertation titled *Evaluating the Impact of Ultra Low Emission Zone Policies on Air Quality and Public Transportation Choices in Central London* by Xiaoyi Chen. The study assesses the effectiveness of ULEZ in reducing air pollution and influencing public transportation usage.

## Abstract

This study evaluates the impact of the Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) policy on air quality and public transportation in Central London from 2019 to 2024. Using data on Nitric Oxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), PM2.5, and PM10 levels, along with traffic flow and public transportation statistics, the research employs spatial interpolation and Kriging techniques to analyze changes in air quality. The findings highlight significant improvements in air quality, particularly reductions in NO and NO2 levels, providing insights for future urban policy planning.

## Methodology

- **Data Sources:** Air pollution levels, traffic flow, and public transport statistics from government and open datasets.
- **Data Processing:** Missing value interpolation and Kriging-based spatial interpolation.
- **Analysis Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), time-series analysis, and regression modeling.

## Key Findings

- ULEZ implementation led to notable reductions in NO and NO2 levels, particularly in high-traffic areas like the City of London, Camden, and Kensington.
- Public transportation usage saw an increase, suggesting a behavioral shift due to the policy.
- Kriging-based spatial interpolation effectively estimated air quality improvements in targeted zones.
